# Jet Lag: The Game Hide & Seek Home Game Station Radiusifier

Turn raw station KML files into clear, visual catchment maps in seconds.

This tool takes existing station/location data and produces clean radius polygons around every station — ready for use in mapping tools like Google Earth, Google My Maps, GIS platforms, or planning workflows.

Originally built to support home games of Jet Lag: The Game – Hide & Seek mode, where fast, accurate station catchment visualisation is essential for game design and balancing.

## What This Project Does
### 📍 Generates Station Catchment Areas

Every station point in your KML file gets a circular catchment polygon at a defined radius. No manual drawing. No GIS knowledge required.

Perfect for building play zones and movement boundaries in Jet Lag: The Game home versions, or any project that needs station-based distance visualisation.

### 🧠 Geographically Correct Calculations

Catchments are calculated using spherical Earth math — not flat map approximations — so distances remain accurate regardless of location on the globe.

This matters when players are making strategic decisions based on real travel distance.

### 🎨 Clear, Readable Map Styling

Catchments are styled automatically for visibility:

Solid border for clear boundary definition

Soft translucent fill so base map detail stays visible

Consistent visual rules across all stations

Designed for presentation, planning, gameplay maps, and analysis — not clutter.

### 🗂 Clean KML Output Structure

The generated catchments are placed into a dedicated map layer inside the KML file, keeping your original station data intact and the output easy to work with.

You can toggle catchments on/off easily during game planning.

## What You Get

Input: a KML file containing station points
Output: the same file, enhanced with:

- ✔ Catchment polygons
- ✔ Proper map styling
- ✔ Organised layer structure
- ✔ Geographically accurate geometry

No extra software required beyond a KML viewer.

## Vision
A lightweight, fast tool for turning raw location data into professional, presentation-ready catchment maps — especially for strategic, map-based games like Jet Lag Hide & Seek — without needing full GIS software.
